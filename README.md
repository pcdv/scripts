Miscellaneous scripts:
 - knock.py : a one-page script that serves a web app allowing to plug holes 
   in a firewall for privileged users knowing a private URL and a pre-shared
   password
 - gradlerun.py : allows to run a java process through Gradle, allowing to
   easily compute the classpath according to transitive dependencies of the
   main module.
